# ScoreAnim — Backlog

Items live here so they are not forgotten and not worked on early. Do not
pick these up without an explicit decision.

## Known rendering deviations (vs. the Dorico PDF, found in Phase 0)

See `spikes/NOTES.md` for the full investigation of each.

1. **Sax section bracket missing.** Priority: **fix before first production
   use.** Cause established: the Dorico MusicXML export contains no
   `<part-group>` elements at all, so there is nothing for Verovio to
   render — remedy is a Dorico re-export with bracket/group export enabled,
   or adapter-synthesized brackets.
2. **m. 19 guitar slash notehead renders wrong** (stack of strokes instead
   of a slash). Priority: medium, cosmetic.
3. **"Swing ♩ = 120" renders with a tofu box** before the note glyph.
   Priority: low, cosmetic.
4. **Dorico title block simplified** to Verovio's one-line running header
   (all credit texts present, size/placement differ). Priority: low,
   accepted as-is.

## Deferred (from PHASES.md "Later")

Continuous-scroll presentation; glow (needs perf spike); audio-to-score
auto-alignment provider; custom engraving provider; MIDI input; richer
effect editor; arbitrary-exporter MusicXML robustness.
